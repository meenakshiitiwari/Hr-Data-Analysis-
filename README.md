# Hr-Data-Analysis-SQL Project

This project is a SQL-based analysis of employee attrition, using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover key patterns and trends in employee turnover, salary distribution, job satisfaction, and department-level insights.
The dataset contains information on 1,470 employees, covering their demographics, job roles, income, work experience, satisfaction levels, and whether they have left the company.

Key Features of the Project:
SQL Table Design: Created a relational table (employees) matching the structure of the dataset.

Data Insights Using SQL:
Attrition rates by department, age group, and job role
Average income comparisons across education levels and job types
Relationship between distance from home and attrition

Use Cases:
Enables HR teams to make data-informed decisions about hiring and retention
Helps identify factors contributing to high attrition
Can be extended into dashboards or machine learning applications
